#Historical Background

NAICOB was originally established in 1969 as the Boston Indian Council when it served as the hub of social and civil rights activities for the American Indian community in Boston. The center was later organized as the North American Indian Center of Boston, a non-profit organization, in 1991. Since then, the center has served our community as a place for community, health services, wellness groups, job training, childrenâ€™s and elders programming, and much more.
